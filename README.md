This project is a straightforward todo app designed to build and reinforce skills in the Angular framework for frontend development, ASP.NET Core for backend, and MySQL for database management. In the future, additional technologies such as JWT authentication will be incorporated, and the application will be deployed online. Although simple in scope, this project is intended to strengthen my current tech stack and provide hands-on experience with deployment, authentication, authorization, and key technologies essential to full-stack development.
