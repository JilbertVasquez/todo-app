This project is a straightforward todo-app designed to build and reinforce skills in the Angular framework for frontend development, ASP.NET Core for the backend, MySQL for database management, and JWT authentication. In the future, I'll explore more about the technologies like deploying them online. Although simple in scope, this project is intended to strengthen my current tech stack and provide hands-on experience with deployment, authentication, authorization, and key technologies essential to full-stack development.
